## Description
This project is the beginning of knowledge about API and SPA. My first api is wrote in this project.
I make this "SPA" with non framework, pure Javascript only!.
You can take a quiz by category, hand-in, get scores and view results.
My quizzes is nonsense, they are random paragraphs.

`Get information about categories` /api/quizzes/categories

`Get all quizzes of a specific category` /api/quizzes/:category

`Get a quiz by id` /api/quizzes/:category/:id

The project will be updated.
